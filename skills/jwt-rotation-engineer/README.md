# JWT Rotation Engineer

Category: `backend`
Version: `1.0.0`

Superpower: Modernize session flows with rotating refresh tokens, revocation, and secure cookie handling.

## Trigger signals
- `jwt`
- `refresh token`
- `httpOnly cookie`

## Best-fit files
- `**/auth/**`
- `**/*.ts`
- `**/*.py`

## Inputs to gather
- Relevant files, modules, docs, or data slices that define the current surface area.
- Non-negotiable constraints such as latency, compliance, rollout, or backwards-compatibility limits.
- What success looks like in user, operator, or system terms.
- Contracts, persistence behavior, and operational dependencies such as queues or third-party APIs.

## Recommended workflow
1. Restate the goal, boundaries, and success metric in operational terms.
2. Map the files, surfaces, or decisions most likely to matter first.
3. Model contract, data, and error-flow consequences before recommending implementation shifts.
4. Produce a bounded plan with explicit validation hooks.
5. Return rollout, fallback, and open-question notes for handoff.

## Deliverables
- Capability summary and why this skill fits the request.
- Concrete implementation or decision slices with explicit targets.
- Validation, rollout, and rollback guidance sized to the risk.
- Contract, persistence, and failure-mode changes called out explicitly.
- Observability expectations for success and failure paths.
- Validation plan covering `verify_token_security`.

## Failure modes to watch
- The recommendation is technically correct but not grounded in the actual files, operators, or rollout constraints.
- Validation is skipped or downgraded without clearly stating the residual risk.
- The work lands as a broad rewrite instead of a bounded, reversible slice.
- Interface changes break existing consumers or weaken idempotency and retry behavior.
- Operational degradation paths are missing for dependency or datastore failure.

## Operational notes
- Call out the smallest safe rollout slice before proposing broader adoption.
- Make the validation surface explicit enough that another operator can repeat it.
- State when human approval or stakeholder review is required before execution.
- Monitor latency, error-rate, and retry behavior during rollout, not just correctness.
- Preserve backward-compatible contracts until downstream migration is confirmed.

## Dependency and composition notes
- Use this pack as the lead skill only when it is closest to the actual failure domain or decision surface.
- If another pack owns a narrower adjacent surface, hand off with explicit boundaries instead of blending responsibilities implicitly.
- Often composes with architecture, security, and observability work after contracts are clarified.

## Validation hooks
- `verify_token_security`

## Model preferences
- primary: `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v3.2`
- fallback: `qwen3-coder:480b-cloud`
- local: `deepseek-r1:32b`

## Pack contents
- `SKILL.md` for portable agent-skill usage
- `skill.yaml` for runtime registry loading
- `marketplace.yaml` for catalog metadata and richer automation
