# Content Security Policy Architect

Category: `security`
Version: `1.0.0`

Superpower: Design nonce- and policy-based browser defenses that meaningfully shrink XSS blast radius.

## Trigger signals
- `content security policy`
- `nonce`
- `strict dynamic`

## Best-fit files
- `**/*.ts`
- `**/*.html`
- `**/headers/**`

## Inputs to gather
- Relevant files, modules, docs, or data slices that define the current surface area.
- Non-negotiable constraints such as latency, compliance, rollout, or backwards-compatibility limits.
- What success looks like in user, operator, or system terms.
- Assets, trust boundaries, attacker assumptions, and unacceptable exposure paths.

## Recommended workflow
1. Restate the goal, boundaries, and success metric in operational terms.
2. Map the files, surfaces, or decisions most likely to matter first.
3. Model trust boundaries, likely abuse paths, and blast radius before mitigation ordering.
4. Produce a bounded plan with explicit validation hooks.
5. Return rollout, fallback, and open-question notes for handoff.

## Deliverables
- Capability summary and why this skill fits the request.
- Concrete implementation or decision slices with explicit targets.
- Validation, rollout, and rollback guidance sized to the risk.
- Threats or findings ordered by severity and exploitability.
- Residual risk notes after mitigations are applied.
- Validation plan covering `verify_csp_enforcement`.

## Failure modes to watch
- The recommendation is technically correct but not grounded in the actual files, operators, or rollout constraints.
- Validation is skipped or downgraded without clearly stating the residual risk.
- The work lands as a broad rewrite instead of a bounded, reversible slice.
- Mitigations look strong on paper but leave an easy bypass in adjacent systems or tools.
- Sensitive data, exploit detail, or unsafe shortcuts slip into the output surface.

## Operational notes
- Call out the smallest safe rollout slice before proposing broader adoption.
- Make the validation surface explicit enough that another operator can repeat it.
- State when human approval or stakeholder review is required before execution.
- Log what was checked, what remains unverified, and which mitigations depend on human enforcement.
- Prefer controls that fail closed or degrade safely when confidence is low.

## Dependency and composition notes
- Use this pack as the lead skill only when it is closest to the actual failure domain or decision surface.
- If another pack owns a narrower adjacent surface, hand off with explicit boundaries instead of blending responsibilities implicitly.
- Often composes with backend, devops, and architecture packs once threats are prioritized.

## Validation hooks
- `verify_csp_enforcement`

## Model preferences
- primary: `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v3.2`
- fallback: `qwen3-coder:480b-cloud`
- local: `deepseek-r1:32b`

## Pack contents
- `SKILL.md` for portable agent-skill usage
- `skill.yaml` for runtime registry loading
- `marketplace.yaml` for catalog metadata and richer automation
